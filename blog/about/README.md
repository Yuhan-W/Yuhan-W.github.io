Xiaohan is currently a ~~dragon lost in human world~~ [Computer Science](https://www.bu.edu/cs/) master's student at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/). Prior to that, she received her bachelor's degree in [Software Engineering](http://sse.tongji.edu.cn/) at [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/), where she worked with [Prof. Qinpei Zhao](http://sse.tongji.edu.cn/zhaoqinpei) for her undergraduate thesis. She has also luckily worked in [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) as a research intern with [Prof. Tong Lin](http://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/jzyg/szdw/lt.htm).

Her current research interests lie primarily in topics related to exploring the capability of machines to be continual, generalizable and data-efficient, like continual learning, meta-learning and few-shot learning. She also has experience in vision-language learning and video understanding.
