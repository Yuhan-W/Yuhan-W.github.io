### Definition 1
Let $G$ be a group and $X$ a subset of $G$. Let $\lbrace H_i\ | \ i \in I\rbrace$ be the collection of all subgroups containing $X$. Then $\bigcap\limits_{i\in I} H_i$ is called the subgroups of $G$ generated by the set $X$, denoted $\langle X\rangle$. If $a\in G$, the subgroup $\langle a\rangle$ is called the \emph{\textbf{cyclic group}} generated by $a$.

It is clear that $\langle X\rangle = \lbrace a_{1}^{m_1}a_{2}^{m_2}\dots a_{i}^{m_i}\mid a_i\in G, m_i\in \mathbf{Z}\rbrace$ and that $\langle a\rangle=\lbrace a^n\mid n\in \mathbf{Z}\rbrace $(not difficult to prove).

### Theorem 1
Every infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group $\mathbf{Z}$. Every finite cyclic group of order $m$ is isomorphic to the additive group $\mathbf{Z_m}$.

**Proof**
Let $G$ be a group. The map $f:\mathbf{Z}\rightarrow G$ defined as $k\mapsto g^k$ is obviously an epimorphism. Using the first isomorphism theorem of groups, we have $$\mathbf{Z}/ \mathrm{Ker}\ f\cong G$$ If $G$ is infinite, then $$\mathrm{Ker}\ f=\lbrace 0\rbrace\Rightarrow \mathbf{Z}/\mathrm{Ker}\ f=\mathbf{Z}$$ If $G$ is finite, then $$\mathrm{Ker}\ f=\lbrace \bar 0, \bar 1, \dots, \overline{m-1}\rbrace \Rightarrow \mathbf{Z}/\mathrm{Ker}\ f = \mathbf{Z_m}.$$

Since the structure of cyclic groups is rather simple, we are able to quickly understand some properties of cyclic groups. For instance, every homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic. Another typical property of cyclic groups is presented as the following theorem.

### Theorem 2
Let $H$ be a nontrivial subgroup of group $G=\langle a\rangle$. If $m$ is the least positive integer such that $a^m\in H$, then $H=\langle a^m\rangle.$

**Proof**
It is apparent that $\langle a^m\rangle\subset H$. Conversly if $a^h \in H$, then $a^h = a^{qm+r}$ with $0\leq r<m$. Therefore, $a^r=a^{h-qm}\in H$. Since $m$ is the minimal integer such that $a^m\in H$, it is evident that $r=0$ and that $h=qm$. As a result, $H\subset \langle a^m\rangle$.
